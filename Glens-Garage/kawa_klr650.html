                    <h5> I found this on KSl.com/classifieds for $1200. The pictures were quite deceving to the actual shape of the bike!</h5>
                    <h5>The guy bought it off a Junk-yard, and it was unclear how long since it had been running. The grips had melted to glue, the seat is shreaded, and the rear tire has the tube hanging out of the tire bead..</h5>
                    <h5>I tried to walk away from it, and not purchase it. The seller dropped his price to $900 with the title, and I couldn't pass up the project!</h5>
