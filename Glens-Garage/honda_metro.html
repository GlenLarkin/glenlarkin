                        <h4>Full Story:</h4>
                        I found the Metropolitan at about 6pm and messaged the seller promptly, knowing that she was a far distance away. For the sake of this woman's identity, we will call her Marge.
                        I made arrangements to meet her the following morning. After receiving her address and filling the jeep up with gas I drove 150 to Roosevelt, Utah. I arrived to a newer house in a nice neighborhood, to find that Marge had given me the wrong address.
                        Once obtaining her real address, I found her on the side of the road waiting for me, on the Metropolitan. I followed her to a ranch that was located off the main road (sketchy) and we met two older men there. (in their 70's) 
                        Marge had picked it up a couple of months before because she did not have a drivers license, and she believed no license was required for a 49cc moped. SHE HAD AQUIRED 7SEVEN NO LICENSE TICKETS!
                        She had spray painted it pink and glued green cartoon martians to the speedo and fairings. She also scotch taped pictures of her kids to the inside of the steering column. Marge definitely fit the stereotype of Roosevelt, that's for sure!
                        Originally Marge claimed that the Metropolitan had 300 miles total on the ad, but upon futher investigation the speedo read 10x the amount of milage at 3000! Still super low for being 16 years old. We used ramps to get it in the Jeep, I gave them $400 in cash, and then drove off.
                        As I was first leaving, I saw the three of them in a truck behind me. As if they were now following me.. But after a couple of miles they turned a different way to spend that money on only God knows what.
