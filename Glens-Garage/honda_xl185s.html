                    <h3>History:</h3>
                    <h5> Found this in the Avenues for $400, barely running. My first motorcycle eve!</h5>
                    <h5> I brought it back to life with a new throttle, carb clean, header pipe, 12v conversion, and lights! Super fun little dual sport to learn how to ride on.</h5>
                    <h5>I sold the bike to some hick during the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic. I definitely regret the decision!</h5>

                        <li id="mod">Gas Tank: Clean & Paint</li>
                            <ul>
                                <h5>The inside of the tank was covered in surface rust!</h5>
                                <li>I soaked the interior with vinegar and salt for 3 days.</li>
                                <li>Sanded down original paint, covered in Rust Reformer, Primer, and a red base, accented by a grey stripe.</li>
                                <li>I designed my own Honda logo in Japanese with the wings, to have a friend cut out of vynyl.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li id="mod">6v to 12V Conversion</li>
                        <ul>
                            <h5>The original 6v electrical system had to go!</h5>
                            <li>Main component in the switch was the rectifier/regulator! I found a high preformance new model from a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/str/braintarpstore">seller in the United States!</a></li>
                            <li>7" Emgo headlight with 12v bulb, housed bulk of wiring,</li>
                            <li>LED Taillight/Turnsignal array strip mounted under original headlight</li>
                            <li>Cheapo Front turnsignals from Amazon, mounted into the headlight</li>
                            <li>New 12v battery until it got stolen, and then I just ran the bike of the altrenator. Kickstarts FTW!</li>

                                <h5>It was so crusty, it wouldn't spring back! The inner wires had Split!</h5>
                                <li>The Parts store didn't have a match, so they had to resolder/rebuild the cable</li>
                                <li>Clutch cable was super loose, and needed to be remounted to the engine case, in order to be tight enough.</li>
                                <li>Choke cable was relocated down into the carb.</li>
