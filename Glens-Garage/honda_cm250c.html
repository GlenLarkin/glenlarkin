                    <h3>History:</h3>
                    <h5>Browsing on Facebook MarketPlace, I stumbled upon this classic. I happened to find it the same weekend as the KLR, but decided to chase down both anyway!</h5>
                    <h5>A very nice lady was selling it after someone had attempted to steal the bike a week before! They cut the ignition wires and dented the gas tank, but they failed to take the bike!</h5>
                    <h5>I knew that this project wouldnt need to much to get going, for $600 I practically felt like I was stealing it. WE GOT IT RUNNING THAT NIGHT!</h5>

                            <li>Had to drive around to 4 different places that didn't sell lead-acid batteries</li>
                            <li>Reserved one from O'Reilly Auto parts, and picked it up. They made me wait 4 hours for it, but I still had to activate the battery myself.</li>
                            <li>Broke the Cell Seal, and poored in the battery acid. Let charge for 3 hours. Connected it up to the bike, and fit it in the original battery box.</li>

                                <li>Clutch cable was super loose, and needed to be remounted to the engine case, in order to be tight enough.</li>
