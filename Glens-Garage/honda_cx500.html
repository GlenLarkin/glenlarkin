                    <h3>History:</h3>
                    <h5>Looking to upgrade the Rebel, when I find this built beauty! A couple of towns away someone had listed this bike for sale at about half what they paid for it!</h5>
                    <h5>After going through the pictures I knew that I had found the ultimate cafe racer! A Vintage shaft-driven Honda that had been modernized with newer suspension, brakes, and electronics.</h5>
                    <h5>I tried to strap it down, but it fell over in the moving van on the way home! That bent the left foot peg and shifter, but I was able to bend everything back and get it riding again!</h5>

                            <li>Had to drive around to 4 different places that didn't sell lead-acid batteries</li>
                            <li>Reserved one from O'Reilly Auto parts, and picked it up. They made me wait 4 hours for it, but I still had to activate the battery myself.</li>
                            <li>Broke the Cell Seal, and poored in the battery acid. Let charge for 3 hours. Connected it up to the bike, and fit it in the original battery box.</li>
