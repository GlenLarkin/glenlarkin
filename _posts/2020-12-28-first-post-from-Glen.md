### Welcome to my Blog

Greetings! I have converted my Portfolio Website into a Blog!

I am super passionate about computers and have been learning how to use them my entire life! 

A quick about me: I am a Technical Support Engineer and system admin that is developing my skills in Penetration testing and Python. I love learning new things that automate the daily mundane tasks of computers to make life more meaningful. I enjoy sharing what I learn with others, and I want this blog to be a resource of knowledge for anyone interesting in using computers to complete their daily tasks!

Computers require a lot of patience to learn how to use and become proficient with. It requires a lot of research and time to use computers to their max capability. Here I will share the new things that I learn that I know will benefit others and help them on their journey to computer mastery. I am a aspiring software engineer, and have written many simple apps and programs for myself. One day I would like to be able to create a polished application for the iOS App Store and have others use my software and benefit from it.

Join me in my journey as I set goals and take advantage of old and new technology. I am very nostalgic towards the tech that I grew up with and have started a collection of iPods. Thank you @DankPods on Youtube for teaching me how to repair and sharing excitement with the community!

I hope those who find this blog can find the same excitement and joy that I receive in using computers!

Welcome along!!
