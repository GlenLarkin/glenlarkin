                        Found this in the Avenues for $400, barely running. My first motorcycle ever. I brought it back to life with a new throttle, carb clean, header pipe, 12v conversion, and lights! Super fun little dual sport to learn how to ride on. I sold it to some hick during the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic.

                        Finding myself Motorcycle-less, I knew that I needed another project to work on. Stumbled upon this on FB Marketplace for $600. I have always wanted a cafe racer/scrambler to ride around on. After owning this for a couple of months, I've decided that it's too big of a project for me to take on right now... One day!

                        Found in Roosevelt, UT about 3 hours away. Purchased from a drug user that had spray-painted what once was red, to pink. She glued some figurines and made a couple of other odd Modifications.
                        Replaced the electronic choke, cleaned carb, replaced tires, and I am still in the process of getting the pink to look right.                    </h5>

                        Purchased the same night as the KLR, I just needed a running motorcycle after selling my first Honda XL185. Someone had attempted to steal and hot-wire the ignition, but dented the gas tank along the way, so I bought it for $600 Cash. Put some bullet connectors on the six ignition wires and a new rear tire! The first motorcycle that I have ever officially registered!
