        <h1 id="bio">Howdy!</h1>
        <p>I have grown up and lived in Salt Lake City just about my entire life. <br>I appreciate the change in weather and love the access to mountains for my Jeep and motorcycles. <br>(I am a gearhead, anything with a manual trans)</p>
        <p>I have loved technology since I was a kid and started troubleshooting at a very young age. <br>I was writing iPhone apps in 2009 (13yrs old) and would dip my skills into whatever new tech I could get my hands on. <br>I still feel as though I learn something new each day!</p>
        <p>In 2016, after coming home from a 2-year stint in Manhattan, New York, I started working at the Genius Bar of an Apple Retail Store. <br>Within a year, I was able to confidently fix and troubleshoot Macs, iPhones, iPad, Apple Watch, Networking routers, and any other product that Apple produces. I will have worked at Apple for four years, come November.</p>
        <p>Early 2019, I was re-inspired by a friend to start coding again in Swift, Swift UI, Python, and HTML/CSS. I had no teacher, just the internet, and a couple of books. <br>I have the motivation and perseverance to teach myself anything I need. <br>Learning how to conduct my own research and studies is a huge part of my success. I have performed countless software and hardware repairs, and perfected my customer service skills.</p>
        <p>I donâ€™t know everything, but I know where to look and how to find it. Technology is my passion, it never takes a day off, always pushing us forward. I classify myself as a modifier/technician.</p>
        <p>Hobbies include: Film Photography, wrenching on any vehicle, building computers, purchasing broken things and fixing them.</p>
        <li>A <strong>modifier</strong> at heart, a <strong>creator</strong> by trade.</li>
        <li>Glen is <strong>24 years old</strong>, and lives in <em>Downtown <strong>Salt Lake City</strong></em></li>

      <h1 id="origin">Why the name Papercup72?</h1>
      <p>2007 was the first year my family bought a new computer, a white Plastic iMac, <em>(right after the switch to intel processors)</em><br>
        I was able to snag glenlarkin <em>this</em> and glenlarkin <em>that</em> for my username, but it had already been taken on <strong>eBay</strong>.<br>
        I tried a couple of variations off my name, but nothing stood out to me. <em>I was only 12 at the time...</em><br>
        A <strong>Papercup</strong> was just sitting there on the desk, and the answer for the daily math question was <strong><em>72</em></strong>!<br>
        The two most random things I could think of at the time, and the name has stuck with me ever since!
